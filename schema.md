# Understanding the output schema

The Element Classification enrichment is deprecated and will no longer be available, effective **10 July 2020**.
{: important}

After a document is ingested by using Element Classification, the service returns JSON output in the following schema for version date `2018-10-15` or later. The output is included in the `enriched_html_elements` object.

## Schema arrangement
{: #schema-arrangement}

The Element Classification enrichment is deprecated and will no longer be available, effective **10 July 2020**.
{: important}

The schema is arranged as follows.

  - `document`: An object that lists basic information about the document, including:
    - `title`: The document title, if detected.
    - `html`: The full text of the input document in HTML format.
    - `hash`: The MD5 hash of the input document.
  - `model_id`: The analysis model to be used by the service. For the `/v1/element_classification` and `/v1/comparison` methods, the default is `contracts`. For the `/v1/tables` method, the default is `tables`. These defaults apply to the stand-alone methods and to the methods' use in batch-processing requests.
  - `model_version`: The version of the analysis model specified by the value of the `model_id` parameter.
  - `elements`: An array of the document elements detected by the service.
    - `location`: An object that identifies the location of the element. The object contains two index numbers, `begin` and `end`. The index numbers indicate the beginning and ending positions, respectively, of the element as character numbers in the HTML document that the service created from your input document.
    - `text`: The text of the element.
    - `types`: An array that describes what the element is and whom it affects.
      - `label`: An object that defines the type by using a pair of the following elements:
        - `nature`: The type of action the sentence requires. Current values are `Definition`, `Disclaimer`, `Exclusion`, `Obligation`, and `Right`.
        - `party`: A string that identifies the party to whom the sentence applies.
      - `provenance_ids`: An array of one or more hashed values that you can send to IBM to provide feedback or receive support.
    - `categories`: An array that lists the functional categories into which the element falls; in other words, the subject matter of the element.
      - `label`: A string that lists the identified category. You can find a list of [categories](/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-contract_parsing#contract_categories) in [Understanding element classification](/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-contract_parsing).
      - `provenance_ids`: An array of one or more hashed values that you can send to IBM to provide feedback or receive support.

    - `interpretation`: The details of the normalized text, if applicable.
      - `value`: A string listing the value that was found in the normalized text.
      - `numeric_value`: An integer or float expressing the numeric value of the `value` key.
      - `unit`\*\*: A string listing the unit of the value that was found in the normalized text.

### \*Notes on tables
{: #table-notes}

The Element Classification enrichment is deprecated and will no longer be available, effective **10 July 2020**.
{: important}

  - Row and column index values per cell are zero-based and so begin with `0`.
  - Multiple values in arrays of `row_header_ids` and `row_header_texts` elements indicate a possible hierarchy of row headers.
  - Multiple values in arrays of `column_header_ids` and `column_header_texts` elements indicate a possible hierarchy of column headers.

### \*\*Note on `unit` values
{: #unit-values-note}

The value of `unit` is the [ISO-4217 currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html){: external} identified for the currency amount (for example, `USD` or `EUR`). If the service cannot disambiguate a currency symbol (for example, `$` or `£`), the value of `unit` contains the ambiguous symbol as-is.
  
### Note on `location` objects
{: #location-note}

The Element Classification enrichment is deprecated and will no longer be available, effective **10 July 2020**.
{: important}

The `location` object is included with the majority of element definitions. The object identifies the location of an element. The object contains two index numbers, `begin` and `end`. The index numbers indicate the beginning and ending positions, respectively, of the element as character numbers in the HTML document that the service created from your input document.
  
For example, a `text` string with the value `Amount due` might have a corresponding `location` object such as
```json
{
  ...
  "location": {
    "begin": 2510,
    "end": 2519
  }
  ...
}
  ```
The `begin` index indicates that the string begins at character position `2510` in the transformed HTML; this is the location of the letter `A` in `Amount`. The `end` index indicates that the string ends at character position `2519`; this is the location of the letter `e` in `due`.
